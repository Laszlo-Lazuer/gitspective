gitspective
============

This is a result of a random idea "What would my github events look like in a timeline view?". So I built it.

This is still rough, so there are bugs. Unfortunately I can only pull down 10 pages of events from Github. I'm going to tinker with http://www.githubarchive.org/ to see if I may be able to get more from that instead.

Oh and the design is hideous. I'd welcome any designers to submit a better design and I'd integrate it.
